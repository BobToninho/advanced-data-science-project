# Advanced Data Science project

Author: Roberto Tonino

In this presentation we're going to explore the dataset and search for a correlation between the app's rating, price, number of reviews, and category. The next slides will show the findings on this topic.
This is important for app developers as they can use this information to make changes to their app. An app developer could inspect the results of this project in order to find room for improvement.
